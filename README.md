# Dev_Cheatsheet
Here you can find the resources you need to help yourselves working with HTML. This cheatsheet is made to save you time and increase your productivity as a developer.
No matter whether you are an absolute beginner or an experienced front-end developer, you'll always need this collection of information at your fingertips!
I've tried my best to cover most of the commonly used elements, tags and attributes used by developers, so this should serve as a good reference resource. 

Hope you have found this resource helpful!
